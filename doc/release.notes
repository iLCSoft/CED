    - added OpenGL library paths to the rpath list for preventing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        (set by geant4 env init script) to overwrite the opengl system libraries used
        in the linking of glced with the ones from Mesa (installed in afs), which might
        cause a dramatic performance penalty

| v01-02 |
 --------


    New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY): 
        - Remote access to CED: 
            * Per default CED rejects connects from remote hosts, to
              enable remote access, start CED with option --trust <hostname>. 

            * Example: To allow remote access from host xyz: 
                   glced --trust xyz

        - Use user defined port:
            * To start ced several times on the same host, it is necessary 
              that each instance of CED use a different port. To do that, 
              you are able to set the CED port by set the enviroment 
              variable CED_PORT.

            * Example: Start CED listen on port 8888:
                    export CED_PORT=8888
                    glced

            * Hint: To connect on this CED with Marlin you must set
              the enviroment variable CED_PORT (and for remote access 
              also CED_HOST) before starting Marlin.

    Fixes/Intern stuff
        - Move (Middle mouse button): 
               * Now works correct with rotate
               * Adjusted the move speed, to get the same speed for
                 each zoom level and window size.

        - rotate3d:
              * Helper function: rotates a vector in the 3d room

        - ced_geobox_r_ID:
              * do the same as ced_geobox_r (plus lcio_id) but use
                ced_line_ID, this ensure working picking, fisheye view and
                layerdescription. All other geobox functions ced_geobox_r,
                ced_geobox_ID, ced_geobox, now can use this new function
                instead of having own code.

    Simplified CMakeLists ( added dependency to ILCUTIL package )


 --------
| v01-01 |
 --------

    new features: (H. Hoelbe, DESY)
    - Add popup menu, to change background color, toggle layer visibly etc.
      Rightclick to open/close the menu
    - Add help frame, press 'h' to open/close this frame.
      This frame show shortcuts and the layer descriptions.
    - Viewers are able to add their layer descriptions to CED. This 
      descriptions are shown in the popup menu and the help frame. To 
      add layer descriptions use MarlinCED:set_layer_description or
      MarlinCED:add_layer_description. 
    - Added test_ced_mhits (draws 1.000.000 random hits)

    changes/bug fixes: (H. Hoelbe, DESY)
    -  Make CED faster by adapt the frequence when the socket get read.
    -  Removed compiler warnings
    -  Zoom in/out are additional added to +/-
    -  More possible background colors
    -  User defined background color are now also accessible by pressing 'b' 
       or using the popup menu
    -  removed old makefiles

 --------
| v01-00  |
 ---------
     new features: (H. Hoelbe, DESY)
     -  enabled picking (double-click on objects)
     -  zoom (mouse-wheel)
     -  backgroud color option (e.g. glced -bgcolor black)
     -  new ced_write_text function

      merged from calice branch:
       - filled boxes

       - b-key toggles background color 
         (light-blue, black, gray shades, white)
	
     bug fix: 
        -  CED no longer crashes when drawing more 
           than ~350.000 hits (H. Hoelbe)

 -----------
| v00-07   |
 -----------
    * added new Fisheye view functionality 
    * added server client communication 
    * started to add picking functionality
    (S. Martin-Haugh)        

 -----------
| v00-06   |
 -----------
    * added new functionality to draw (S. Darasz):
        - rotated and translated geo_cylinders
        - transparent and wireframe ellipsoids
        - cones and boxes
        - code to display a color map legend
    * cmake improvements:
        - added CED_LIBRARY_DIRS
        - added 32 bit compatibility build option
        - made cmake 2.6 compatible
        - bug fix for building ced server on mac

 --------
| v00-05 |
 --------
      * restructered build process: 
        default is to build true client library libCED.so 
        - optionally also build CED server glced (needs glut/OpenGL)
          with cmake switch -D CED_SERVER=ON 

      * install only ced_cli.h 

 -----------
| v00-04-01 |
 -----------

  -------
 | v00-04 |
  -------

	 -  added layer functionality to CED_GeoBoxR
	 -  added a unique id variable (int) to CED_Hit, which is printed to
		screen whenever the 'C' key is pressed to center on a hit

  -------
 | v00-03 |

    - improved MacOSX support (cmake)
 
  -------
 | v00-02 |
  -------

	 - ported to MAC (thanks to E. Corrin)  (need to build with cmake)  
     F.Gaede, DESY:
     - added world_size command line parameter to glced

     - replaced fixed size window geometry with geometry comand-line option
